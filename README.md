# Notes on *Primes of the Form x²+ny²*

## Background

I've found that I have several bad habits when it comes to reading math books. If I'm actively taking notes as I read, I might
 * Make them unreadable or incomplete, since they are "just notes"
 * Lose them, since they are just scribbles kept on a piece of paper somewhere
 * Never look at them again, for a combination of the reasons above
 * Stop taking notes altogether, for a combination of the reasons above

This is unacceptable. The result is that I don't learn the material at the depth that I need to in order to progress further.

## What's inside

I'm reading David Cox's book *Primes of the Form x²+ny²* from front to back. This repository is an experimental solution in which I hold myself accountable by keeping clear, readable, thorough notes on what I work through. Specifically, I document proofs, exercises, thoughts, and related material that I encounter. In addition to forcing active engagement with the material and discouraging harmful shortcuts, doing this also has the side effect of creating a tangible reference should I ever need to remind myself of anything in the future.

There are many results that are easily turned into algorithms. I will include implementations of some of these results in Scheme as I write them.

## What's **not** inside

Don't mistake this work for an attempt to replace or even improve the exposition of the book. I'm only documenting my learning process. Also, if you're a student who is seeing this material for the first time, I would advise against the temptation to read my notes in lieu of working through the book yourself. The book is terrific and you would be doing yourself a disservice. Finally, if you're doing a homework assignment and looking here for solutions, shame on you.
